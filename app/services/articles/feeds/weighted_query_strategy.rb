      # This constant defines the allowable relevance scoring methods.
      #
      # A scoring method should be a SQL fragement that produces a
      # value between 0 and 1.  The closer the value is to 1, the more
      # relevant the article is for the given user.  Note: the values
      # are multiplicative.  Make sure to consider if you want a 0
      # multiplier for your score.
      #
      # In addition, as part of initialization, the caller can
      # configure each of the scoring methods :cases and :fallback.
      #
      # Each scoring method has three keys:
      #
      # - clause: The SQL clause statement; note: there exists a
      #           coupling between the clause and the SQL fragments
      #           that join the various tables.
      #
      # - cases: An Array of Arrays, the first value is what matches
      #          the clause, the second value is the multiplicative
      #          factor.
      #
      # - fallback: When no case is matched use this factor.
